  <h2>Super Speed</h2> Angler can swim up to 200 mph.
  This allows him to search the seas for his enemy, Kraken.
  This also helps him reach the pollution site in time to save
  the sea life that has fallen victim to it.

<h2>Super Strength</h2> Angler can move an entire oil rig.
This helps him remove the source of pollution that is harming sea life.

<h2>Zoolingualism</h2>
Using his “fishing rod”, the esca,
Angler uses his bioluminescence to communicate
 with sea life in peril and lead them away from harm.
 It also keeps him hyper aware of fish that are in
 distress from pollution or other man made disasters.
 Andras looked just like everyone else in Atlantis
 until one night when everything changed.
